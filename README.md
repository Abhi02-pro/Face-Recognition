# Face-Recognition
Using OpenCV, HaarCascade Classifier and KNN Algorithm to recognize the person in front of the camera.
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Dependencies you need to install:
- Python 3.6
- OpenCV 3.3.0
## Running the tests
1. Clone this repository
``` 
https://github.com/Abhi02-pro/Face-Recognition
```
2. Check if your camera is properly detecting faces by running this command
```
python face_detection.py
```
3. Collect some training data (around 20-30 images) for the algorithm for every new face by running this command
```
python face_data_collect.py
```
4. Now you are all set to recognize a face, run this command
```
python face_recognition.py
```
